# Layout core

A native reimplementation of the XAML layout contract, checked against
measurements recorded from the real `Windows.UI.Xaml`.

It builds and runs anywhere — no WinRT, no Windows, no Wine. That is the point:
the expectations were captured once by [the probe](../harness/xaml_probe.cpp) on
`windows-latest`, and everything after that is a plain native binary diffed
against a JSON file. The loop is seconds long and runs on a Linux laptop.

## Where it stands

Against build `10.0.26100.33158`:

| level | subject | cases | matching |
|-------|---------------------------------------------|------:|---------:|
| L0 | property system | 4 | 2 |
| L1 | one element: explicit size, margin | 72 | **72** |
| L2 | one parent, one child: alignment × margin × sizing | 192 | **192** |
| L3 | panels: `StackPanel`, `Grid` | 132 | **132** |
| L4 | text: `TextBlock` | 72 | **36** without a font — see below |
| L7 | Terminal's own pages | 69 | 0 |

L1–L3 is every case that does not need text measurement or a control set —
`Border`, `Grid`, `StackPanel`, and the `FrameworkElement` semantics under all
of them. L7 fails as `the type 'ScrollViewer' is not implemented` and the like,
rather than as wrong numbers, which is the distinction worth keeping: nothing
here is quietly approximate.

L4 is implemented and is the one level whose result depends on a font. Two of
the numbers inside that font can be solved from the recorded measurements
alone — the baseline-to-baseline distance and the advance width of `M` — and
those are committed, so the 36 cases that depend on nothing else match on a
checkout with no Segoe UI and no artifact:

    measure_cases phase3/xaml-db/cases /tmp/results phase3/xaml-db/fonts/derived

The other 36 measure a word and a pangram, which pin the sum of several
advances and not any one of them. They fail naming the character they have no
advance for, until the harvested metrics are fetched. See
[the fonts directory](../xaml-db/fonts/) and [`text.cpp`](src/text.cpp).

## Running it

    cmake -S phase3/layout -B /tmp/layout-build && cmake --build /tmp/layout-build
    python3 phase3/scripts/fetch_measurements.py          # prints a directory
    python3 phase3/scripts/fetch_measurements.py --fonts  # and the font metrics
    /tmp/layout-build/measure_cases phase3/xaml-db/cases /tmp/layout-results <fonts>
    python3 phase3/scripts/check_layout.py \
        --expected <that directory> --actual /tmp/layout-results --levels L1,L2,L3

The font metrics argument is optional and defaults to `<cases>/../fonts`. Pass
`phase3/xaml-db/fonts/derived` instead to run text against the numbers the
corpus solved for itself; the two directories are never mixed, and a directory
holding two sets of metrics for one family is refused rather than resolved.

`measure_cases` takes the same arguments as the oracle probe and writes the same
files, so the two are directly diffable. A single `g++ -std=c++17 src/*.cpp`
also works if CMake is not worth the trouble.

## What it is a port of

The algorithms come from [dotnet/wpf](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf) (MIT), at
commit `2ca037562c207924e53cfcc99286e523d3694de3` — `FrameworkElement`'s
`MeasureCore`/`ArrangeCore`, and `Border`, `StackPanel` and `Grid`'s
`MeasureOverride`/`ArrangeOverride`. WinUI's own layout core is not public;
WPF's is the same design by the same team, and the corpus decides where they
part company.

Two places where they do, both found by running the corpus rather than by
reading:

**Layout rounding is on.** WPF leaves `UseLayoutRounding` off unless asked;
WinUI has it on. A `2*`/`*` split of 100 arranges as 67 and 33, not 66.6667 and
33.3333. Without it, four L3 cases disagree — and they are the only four whose
star split does not divide evenly, which is what made the cause obvious.

**Grid's rounding remainder goes to star definitions only.** After rounding each
column, the columns can add up to slightly less than the Grid, and the shortfall
is redistributed. Ported as written, that redistribution also fires for a Grid
whose columns are all `Auto` or fixed — which legitimately leave the Grid partly
empty — and grew them by a pixel each. Sixteen L3 cases said otherwise, all of
them star-free.

## Deliberate omissions

Not "to do later" in the vague sense — these are the specific things this code
does not do, so that a passing run is not read as more than it is:

- **Text is measured against rules, not a text stack.** `TextBlock` bottoms out
  in DirectWrite, and there is none here: what [`text.cpp`](src/text.cpp) has
  is three rules read off the corpus, plus a font's advance widths. No
  shaping, no kerning, no ligatures, no fallback for a character the metrics do
  not cover. It stays quarantined at L4 for that reason — text-measurement
  error would otherwise contaminate every panel that contains it.
- **No `Canvas`, no `RelativePanel`, no controls.** Only the three types the
  corpus below L4 uses.
- **No `LayoutTransform`.** WPF measures a transformed element by fitting a
  maximal rectangle in local space; none of that is here.
- **No property system.** Values are plain fields, so L0 only passes where the
  answer does not depend on inheritance or precedence.
- **`Grid` star resolution follows WPF's pre-4.7 algorithm**, not the
  `MaxDiscrepancy` rework. The corpus does not distinguish them: it has no
  definition-level `MinWidth`/`MaxWidth`, which is the only thing they disagree
  about.
- **Round-half-to-even is unconfirmed.** No case in the corpus lands on an exact
  half, so the tie-break is the ported behaviour rather than a measured one.
